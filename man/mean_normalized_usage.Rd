\title{Mean Normalized Usage (MNU) Analysis for Cubist Model Covariates}
\usage{
mean_normalized_usage(df)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame like `cubistusage.csv` with columns such as `model_conditions`,
`model_usage`, `covariates`, `model property`, `model depth`, etc.}
}
\value{
A processed data frame with `normalized_usage` and `mean_normalized_usage` columns.
}
\description{
Computes Mean Normalized Usage (MNU) for covariates used in Cubist-based soil property models.
It accounts for both covariate frequency and model diversity, summarized by analysis scale,
depth class, and statistical aggregation of terrain and imagery covariates.
}
\details{
This function reads a Cubist covariate importance table and calculates
normalized usage values by covariate group, analysis scale, depth class,
and statistical aggregation of terrain and imagery covariates.
