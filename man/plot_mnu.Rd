\title{Plot Mean Normalized Usage (MNU) Results}
\usage{
plot_mnu(df)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame output from `mean_normalized_usage()` with fields
including `Deriv`, `depth_class`, `rel_scale`, `stat`, and `mean_normalized_usage`.}
}
\value{
A `ggplot2` object (patchwork grid of plots) showing MNU patterns across depth classes.
}
\description{
Creates side-by-side `ggplot2` bar charts showing Mean Normalized Usage (MNU)
grouped by either analysis scale (terrain-derived covariates) or temporal/statistical
aggregation (imagery-derived covariates), faceted by depth class.
}
\details{
This function visualizes normalized covariate usage across soil depths and covariate groups.
Plots are returned as a combined `patchwork` object for easy customization or export.
}
\examples{
# Example usage:
df_mnu <- mean_normalized_usage(your_data)
plot_MNU(df_mnu)
